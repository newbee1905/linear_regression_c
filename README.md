# C Machine Learning - Linear Regressions

## About

This is my personal project helping me to understand machine learning and neural network deeper by recreating it with C.

This is not recreating the wheel, since I will likely not use this for any real stuff, I will only use it for educational purpose.

## Sources I used or based of

- [Machine Learning in C by Tscoding](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw) 

## Progress

### Done

- [x] Numerical Differentation
- [x] Linear Regression in Neural Network

### Todo

- [ ] LR scheduler
- [ ] Auto Differentation
- [ ] Optimiser Adam
